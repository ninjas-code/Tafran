     <p className="Para"> <h1>Koel Ganguly</h1>Hands down the best food I had in Jordan. We went with friends while visiting Amman and the whole experience was just great. Every item was delicious and quantity was huge. We ordered various selection of appetizers. The customer service was so very warm and friendly. The restaurant has a very warm welcoming decor.

    <p className="Para"> <h1>mohammad Gmal</h1>best service and food. i highly reccomend it</p> 

    <p className="Para"> <h1>Khaled Kurdi</h1>Tannoureen has always been a family favorite when it comes to Lebanese cuisine.. The falafel are still as Yummy as I remember and the kubbeh niyyeh is outstanding with the garlic paste and onions.The shish kebab, meat, chicken and minced meat are yummy... If you want tasty food go there. The ambiance us very nice although on the noisy side, so this makes it a place were you can have loud conversations rather than a romantic dinner..enjoy.</p>
